# Flow Code Examples

This is the home of all the public examples for how to use Flow's Run code action. Feel free to look around! Do not edit these files directly.

## About the examples

The examples should be working code that can be used as a starting point for your own workflows.

Because the Run code action can be placed in any type of workflow and the data available to the action will vary depending on the type of workflow. For example, a workflow triggered by an Order event will have access to the Order data, but not the data for a specific Product.

## Testing your code

The examples provided contain tests than can be run locally to verify that your code is working as expected. These tests do not guarantee that your code will work in a live environment, but they can help you catch some common mistakes.
